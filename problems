Problems

ToDo:
-Commets
-ListDialog for LOAD
-EDIT should editable the classname, deckname, wins and loses (EDIT not implemented yet)

-Exceptions for InputFrameworks (class InputFramework)

-with duplicate name it will delete the saved progression and the current/new create progression.
Solution: Throw Exception while creating a new deck with same name
	  Throw warning message that it will delete every deck with the same name
